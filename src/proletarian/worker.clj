(defn process-next-job!
  "Gets the next job from the database table and runs it.

   This function is part of the internal machinery of the Proletarian worker, but is being exposed as a public function
   for use in testing scenarios and in the REPL. No default values are provided for any of the arguments or
   configuration options. See the documentation for, and implementation of, [[create-queue-worker]] for what those
   default values are. It might be a good idea to create a wrapper function around this function, for use in your own
   application, that provides sensible values for all the arguments and config.

   ### Arguments
   * `data-source` – a [javax.sql.DataSource](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.sql/javax/sql/DataSource.html)
       factory for creating connections to the PostgreSQL database.
   * `queue` – a keyword with the name of the queue.
   * `handler-fn` – the function that will be called when a job is pulled off the queue. It should be an arity-2
       function or multimethod. The first argument is the job type (as provided to [[proletarian.job/enqueue!]]). The
       second argument is the job's payload (again, as provided to [[proletarian.job/enqueue!]]).
   * `log` – a logger function that Proletarian calls whenever anything interesting happens during operation. It takes
       two arguments: The first is a keyword identifying the event being logged. The second is a map with data
       describing the event.
   * `config` – a map describing configuration options, see below.

   ### Config
   * `:proletarian.db/job-table` – which PostgreSQL table to write the job to.
   * `:proletarian.db/archived-job-table` – which PostgreSQL table to write archived jobs to.
   * `:proletarian.db/serializer` – an implementation of the [[proletarian.protocols/Serializer]] protocol. You should
       use the same serializer for [[proletarian.job/enqueue!]].
   * `:proletarian/uuid-serializer` - an implementation of the `[[proletarian.protocols/UuidSerializer]] protocol.
       Its role is to help in the serializing and deserializing of UUIDs to accomodate various database
       requirements. It defaults to `proletarian.uuid.postgresql/create-serializer`. A `proletarian.uuid.mysql/create-serializer`
       is available if you wish to use MySQL with this library. If you override the default, you should use the same
       serializer for [[proletarian.job/enqueue!]].
   * `:proletarian.worker/clock` – a [java.time.Clock](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/time/Clock.html)
       instance to use for getting the current time.

   Returns true if there was a job to be run, and the current thread did not receive an interrupt while handling the
   job. Returns false if there was an interrupt.
   Returns nil if there was no job to be run."

  "Create and return a Queue Worker, which is an instance of [[proletarian.protocols/QueueWorker]]. After creation, the
   Queue Worker must be started using [[start!]], and can be stopped using [[stop!]].

   ### Arguments
   * `data-source` – a [javax.sql.DataSource](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.sql/javax/sql/DataSource.html)
      factory for creating connections to the PostgreSQL database.
   * `handler-fn` – the function that will be called when a job is pulled off the queue. By default this should be an
      arity-2 function or multimethod. The first argument is the job type (as provided to [[proletarian.job/enqueue!]]).
      The second argument is the job's payload (again, as provided to [[proletarian.job/enqueue!]]). This mode of
      calling the handler-fn can be changed with the `:proletarian/handler-fn-mode`, see below.
   * `options` – an optional map describing configuration options, see below.

   ### Options
   The optional third argument is an options map with the following keys, all optional with default values:
   * `:proletarian/queue` – a keyword with the name of the queue. The default value is `:proletarian/default`.
   * `:proletarian/job-table` – which PostgreSQL table to write the job to. The default is `proletarian.job`. You should
       only have to override this if you changed the default table name during installation.
   * `:proletarian/archived-job-table` – which PostgreSQL table to write archived jobs to. The default is
       `proletarian.archived_job`. You should only have to override this if you changed the default table name during
       installation.
   * `:proletarian/serializer` – an implementation of the [[proletarian.protocols/Serializer]] protocol. The default is
       a Transit serializer (see [[proletarian.transit/create-serializer]]). If you override this, you should use the
       same serializer for [[proletarian.job/enqueue!]].
   * `:proletarian/handler-fn-mode` – a keyword that specifies how the `handler-fn` will be called. The default is
       `:default`. Possible values:
       - `:default` – Call the `handler-fn` with two arguments, the job type and the payload (see `handler-fn` above)
       - `:advanced` - Call the `handler-fn` with one argument, a map with the job's attributes:
           `:proletarian.job/job-type`, `:proletarian.job/payload`, `:proletarian.job/job-id`, `:proletarian.job/queue`,
           `:proletarian.job/enqueued-at`, `:proletarian.job/process-at` and `:proletarian.job/attempts`.
   * `:proletarian/retry-strategy-fn` – a function that will be called to provide the __retry strategy__ for a job if it
       fails. It should be an arity-2 function or multimethod. The first argument is a map with the job's attributes:
       `:proletarian.job/job-type`, `:proletarian.job/payload`, `:proletarian.job/job-id`, `:proletarian.job/queue`,
       `:proletarian.job/enqueued-at`, `:proletarian.job/process-at` and `:proletarian.job/attempts`. The second
       argument is the exception that caused the job to fail. It should return a map that specifies the
       [retry strategy](/readme#retries).
   * `:proletarian/failed-job-fn` – a function that will be called when a job has failed after retries. It should be an
       arity-2 function or multimethod. The first argument is a map with the job's attributes (see
       `:proletarian/retry-strategy-fn`). The second argument is the exception that caused the job to fail the last
       time.
   * `:proletarian/log` – a logger function that Proletarian calls whenever anything interesting happens during
       operation. It takes two arguments: The first is a keyword identifying the event being logged. The second is a map
       with data describing the event. The default logging function is simply a println-logger that will print
       every event using `println`.
   * `:proletarian/queue-worker-id` – a string identifying this Queue Worker. It is used as a thread prefix for names of
       threads in the thread pool. It is also added to the log event data under the key
       `:proletarian.worker/queue-worker-id`. The default value is computed from the name of the queue that this worker
       is getting jobs from.
   * `:proletarian/polling-interval-ms` – the time in milliseconds to wait after a job is finished before polling for a
       new one. The default value is 100 milliseconds.
   * `:proletarian/worker-threads` – the number of worker threads that work in parallel. The default value is 1.
   * `:proletarian/on-polling-error` – a function that Proletarian calls when a Throwable is thrown during polling for
       jobs. It takes one argument, the Throwable that was thrown. If it returns a truthy value, the Queue Worker is
       stopped. The default behavior is to stop the Queue Worker.
   * `:proletarian/await-termination-timeout-ms` – the time in milliseconds to wait for jobs to finish before throwing
       an error when shutting down the thread pool. The default value is 10000 (10 seconds).
   * `:proletarian/install-jvm-shutdown-hook?` – should Proletarian install a JVM shutdown hook that tries to stop the
       Queue Worker (using [[stop!]]) when the JVM is shut down? The default is `false`.
   * `:proletarian/on-shutdown` – a function that Proletarian calls after the Queue Worker has shut down successfully.
       It takes no arguments, and the return value is discarded. The default function is a no-op.
   * `:proletarian/clock` – the [[java.time.Clock]] to use for getting the current time. Used in testing. The default is
       [[java.time.Clock/systemUTC]]."
